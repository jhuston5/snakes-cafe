# Initial Version of Lab 01

## Program Overview

This console program allows users to select foods from a list of options, then stores the number of times that food is ordered.

## Collaboration

Thanks to Bionca Bond for helping me work through this one, particularly in solving how to modularize food data storage, and then call it in the main module.
